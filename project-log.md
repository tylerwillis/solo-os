# SOLO-OS Project Log

## Entry 1: Project Planning

### Implementation Strategy

#### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity and portability
- **Terminal UI**: 
  - blessed/blessed-contrib for rich terminal interface
  - commander.js for command parsing
  - chalk for colorized output
  - inquirer for interactive prompts

#### Architecture Design
- **Command Pattern**: Each feature will be implemented as a command module
- **Data Models**:
  - Users (authentication, profiles)
  - Posts (bulletin board, announcements)
  - Commands (extensibility via `make`)
  - Guestbook (visitor entries)
  - Weekly (accountability posts)

#### Directory Structure
