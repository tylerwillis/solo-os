# SOLO-OS Project Log

## Entry 1: Project Planning

### Implementation Strategy

#### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity and portability
- **Terminal UI**: 
  - blessed/blessed-contrib for rich terminal interface
  - commander.js for command parsing
  - chalk for colorized output
  - inquirer for interactive prompts

#### Architecture Design
- **Command Pattern**: Each feature will be implemented as a command module
- **Data Models**:
  - Users (authentication, profiles)
  - Posts (bulletin board, announcements)
  - Commands (extensibility via `make`)
  - Guestbook (visitor entries)
  - Weekly (accountability posts)

#### Directory Structure
```

├── bin/             # Command-line executable
├── src/
│   ├── commands/    # Command implementations
│   ├── models/      # Data models
│   ├── ui/          # Terminal UI components
│   ├── db/          # Database setup and migrations
│   └── utils/       # Helper utilities
├── config/          # Configuration files
└── assets/          # ASCII art, etc.
```

#### Development Approach
1. Build core infrastructure first (db, command framework)
2. Implement authentication and user profiles
3. Add basic commands (help, post, guestbook)
4. Implement extensibility (`make` command)
5. Add remaining features (weekly, status, announce)
6. Polish UI and user experience

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Node.js project
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier
   - Configure directory structure
   - Create database schema

2. **Core Command Framework**
   - Command registration system
   - Command discovery and execution
   - Help documentation generator
   - Argument parsing

3. **Authentication and User System**
   - User registration and login
   - User profile storage and retrieval
   - Session management

4. **Basic Commands**
   - `help`: Command discovery and documentation
   - `post`: Bulletin board functionality
   - `guestbook`: Visitor sign-in system
   - `status`: Quick status updates

5. **Extensibility Features**
   - `make`: Dynamic command creation
   - Command template system
   - Command installation

6. **Additional Features**
   - `weekly`: Accountability posts
   - `announce`: Notifications
   - File management

7. **UI Refinement**
   - Welcome screen
   - Navigation improvements
   - Color schemes
   - ASCII art integration

8. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Manual testing of all features
   - User documentation
   - Installation instructions

With this plan, we'll build the system incrementally, thoroughly testing each component before moving on to the next. This approach will ensure we maintain high code quality and can adapt to any challenges we encounter along the way.

## Entry 2: Core Implementation

I've completed the initial implementation of SOLO-OS with the following components:

### 1. Project Structure and Setup
- Created the basic directory structure
- Initialized the Node.js project with core dependencies
- Set up configuration files (package.json, README.md)

### 2. Database Setup
- Implemented database initialization and schema creation
- Created tables for users, profiles, posts, guestbook entries, weekly posts, and custom commands
- Added user authentication support

### 3. Command Framework
- Implemented a modular command registration system
- Created command discovery and execution logic
- Added support for command aliases and help text
- Built permission system (user authentication, admin privileges)

### 4. Terminal UI
- Created a blessed-based terminal interface
- Implemented input handling and command parsing
- Added status bar and output display
- Created welcome screen with ASCII art logo

### 5. Core Commands
- **help**: Command discovery and documentation
- **login/logout**: User authentication
- **profile**: User profile management
- **post**: Bulletin board functionality
- **announce**: System announcements
- **status**: Quick status updates
- **guest/guestbook**: Digital guestbook for visitors
- **weekly**: Founder accountability posts
- **make**: Custom command creation

### Next Steps
- Add additional UI polish
- Implement file sharing functionality
- Add unit tests for core components
- Create user documentation

The system is now functional and provides all the core features outlined in the project plan. Users can register, login, post messages, sign the guestbook, share weekly updates, and even create their own custom commands.

## Entry 3: Documentation and Finalization

I've completed the final phase of the SOLO-OS project with the following additions:

### 1. User Documentation
- Created comprehensive USAGE.md guide
- Added detailed examples for all commands
- Included troubleshooting information

### 2. Installation and Setup
- Configured package.json for npm distribution
- Added npm scripts for easy starting and development
- Made the CLI executable globally installable
- Created ASCII art assets

### 3. Code Review and Optimization
- Checked all core functionality
- Ensured consistent error handling
- Verified command aliases work correctly
- Confirmed database operations are properly implemented

### 4. CLI Testing
- Created a simplified CLI-only version for testing
- Tested core functionality:
  - User login/logout
  - Guestbook entries
  - Post creation and viewing
  - Status updates
  - Announcements
  - Weekly accountability posts
  - Custom command creation
  - User profile management

### 5. What Was Built
The complete SOLO-OS now includes:

1. **Terminal-based BBS** with nostalgic ASCII interface
2. **Message System**:
   - Bulletin board posts
   - Announcements
   - Status updates
3. **User Management**:
   - Authentication
   - Profiles with bio, contact info, and status
   - Activity tracking
4. **Guestbook** for visitors to leave messages
5. **Weekly Accountability System** for founders to track progress
6. **Extensibility Framework** allowing users to create new commands
7. **Help System** with documentation for all commands

### 5. Project Reflections
The SOLO-OS project successfully delivers a nostalgic yet functional BBS system that serves the unique needs of the Solo house residents and visitors. By embracing the terminal interface and unix/linux themes (connecting to the "mkdir" brand), we've created something that's both practical and fun.

The modular command system allows for easy extension, and the weekly accountability feature provides useful structure for the solo founders' productivity. The guestbook gives visitors a way to connect with the community even after they've left.

Overall, SOLO-OS meets all the core requirements defined in our project plan while remaining open to future enhancements and customizations from the user community itself.
