# SOLO-OS Project Log

## Entry 1: Project Planning

### Implementation Strategy

#### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API endpoints
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity and portability
- **Terminal UI**: 
  - blessed/blessed-contrib for rich terminal interface
  - commander.js for command parsing
  - chalk for colorized output
  - inquirer for interactive prompts

#### Architecture Design
- **Command Pattern**: Each feature will be implemented as a command module
- **Data Models**:
  - Users (authentication, profiles)
  - Posts (bulletin board, announcements)
  - Commands (extensibility via `make`)
  - Guestbook (visitor entries)
  - Weekly (accountability posts)

#### Directory Structure
```

├── bin/             # Command-line executable
├── src/
│   ├── commands/    # Command implementations
│   ├── models/      # Data models
│   ├── ui/          # Terminal UI components
│   ├── db/          # Database setup and migrations
│   └── utils/       # Helper utilities
├── config/          # Configuration files
└── assets/          # ASCII art, etc.
```

#### Development Approach
1. Build core infrastructure first (db, command framework)
2. Implement authentication and user profiles
3. Add basic commands (help, post, guestbook)
4. Implement extensibility (`make` command)
5. Add remaining features (weekly, status, announce)
6. Polish UI and user experience

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Node.js project
   - Set up ESLint and Prettier
   - Configure directory structure
   - Create database schema

2. **Core Command Framework**
   - Command registration system
   - Command discovery and execution
   - Help documentation generator
   - Argument parsing

3. **Authentication and User System**
   - User registration and login
   - User profile storage and retrieval
   - Session management

4. **Basic Commands**
   - `help`: Command discovery and documentation
   - `post`: Bulletin board functionality
   - `guestbook`: Visitor sign-in system
   - `status`: Quick status updates

5. **Extensibility Features**
   - `make`: Dynamic command creation
   - Command template system
   - Command installation

6. **Additional Features**
   - `weekly`: Accountability posts
   - `announce`: Notifications
   - File management

7. **UI Refinement**
   - Welcome screen
   - Navigation improvements
   - Color schemes
   - ASCII art integration

8. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Manual testing of all features
   - User documentation
   - Installation instructions

With this plan, we'll build the system incrementally, thoroughly testing each component before moving on to the next. This approach will ensure we maintain high code quality and can adapt to any challenges we encounter along the way.

### 7. Project Reflections
The SOLO-OS project has evolved into a robust, secure, and feature-complete bulletin board system. By implementing proper user authentication, administrative controls, and security measures, we've made the system suitable for real-world use in the Solo house.

The personalized content for Tyler Willis gives the system an authentic feel, and the GitHub repository makes it accessible to the wider community for contributions and improvements.

This system now combines nostalgic BBS aesthetics with modern security practices and extensibility features, making it both a fun throwback and a practical communication tool for the Solo house community.

## Entry 5: Improved Usability and CLI Experience
